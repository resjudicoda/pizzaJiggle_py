# pizzaJiggle_py

This is version two of one of my personal projects. As of now, it consists of a simple python script that uses OpenCV to apply a "cartoonify" effect to an image. I am still working on implementing the remaining features.

Special thanks to the following article for providing a baseline for me to work out my own cartoonify feature.
