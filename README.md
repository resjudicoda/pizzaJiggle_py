# pizzaJiggle_py

This is version two of one of my personal projects. As of now, it consists of two Python scripts: one that uses OpenCV to apply a "cartoonify" effect to an image; and one that uses PyTorch to detect pizza and OpenCV to crop the image based on the mask created by PyTorch. I am currently working on sorting out the cropping aspect.

Special thanks to the following article for providing a baseline for me to work out my own cartoonify feature.
